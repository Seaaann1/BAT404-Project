The importance of an E-learning game for daycare students is
helpful especially this time of pandemic. The researcher must provide an e-learning
game that will help students to cope up to their subject. In lined with this, the
researcher is dedicated in providing our community with appropriate tools and
significant knowledge to take steps in challenging the students on how to learn in
fun, easy and creative ways.
The researcher necessarily conducts this inquiry to know how important an
e-learning game is. The researcher must also explain their desire to find an effective
e-learning game suitable to every student. The researcher will help the students in
learning while having fun as well.
The decision tree classifier mainly depends on the construction of strong
decision rules which are required to identify learning styles accurately. E Learning
is a way to provide quick delivery of lessons. As compared to traditional classroom
teaching method, this mode has relatively quick delivery cycles. E Learning has
completely transformed the way in which learning is imparted to students. Unlike
traditional chalk and board method of teaching, eLearning makes learning simpler,
easier, and more effective.
