# The Importance of E Learning Game in Modern Technology
The E-learning approach is a way more global and is gaining pace
nowadays. Modern teaching aids are important and most preferred in the
technological age. A modern education system uses technology to impart education.
The growing usage of digital games and applied sciences into learning environments
has affected both the teaching of educators and the learning of students. 
Game-Based Learning (GBL) can be successfully used to improve both
learning and teaching. Game-Based Learning simply means including knowledge
matter of subject into games. All types of games are learning processes, be it casual
gaming for fun. Game-Based Learning plays important role in teaching by making
students to collaborate, communicate, interact and work in teams. One of the key
aspects of game-based learning is that each student receives immediate feedback on
their performance, with suggestions on how they might improve.
